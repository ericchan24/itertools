## Itertools investigation  

In this investigation I examine the itertools module and I do a recap on generators.  
Itertools is a module in the standard python library. It comprises of a set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination.  

### Why is it called itertools?  
It consists of functions made using iterator building blocks. Iterators are any object whose class has a `__next__` and `__iter__` method.

`itertools.ipynb` is the notebook for this investigation.
